## Streamline your windows experience

As a programmer, I like to work efficiently. Lately, I came across a tool that's been around for quite a bit of time. I'm talking about the Windows PowerToys: a softwaresuite of several simple tools to improve productivity, e.g.: a bulk file-renaming tool, a text extractor which can copy text from images, and all sorts of other software that will come in handy with your work.

I'm looking forward using these. I'll add an update to share my experiences.
