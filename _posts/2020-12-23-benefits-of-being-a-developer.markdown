## Automate things non-developers have to do by hand

I wanted to know what my historical monthly mobile cellphone data usage was. Unfortunately this feature wasn't included in the web app of my current telecomprovider... It was only possible to see the usage in small chunks (per day). The total amount per month wasn't showed.

That's why... I created a Google Chrome Extension [see this GitHub repo](https://github.com/JennoVink/MobileDataTotalCalculator)! It's very easy to use. Here's a quick demo:

### Quick demo

### Potential reasons why they didn't implement this

It's an easy feature to implement, but in my opinion, showing this data to customers may result in the realization that they only use a fraction of their subscription. Subsequently, this may result in customers changing their subscriptions to a more economical variant.

### Benefits of being a developer

This project illustrates how easy it is for a developer to solve these digital problems. A non-developer would have to calculate this total by hand, that's not quite as fun as creating it yourself!
