## The idea

I was inspired by [this idea](https://www.conrad.nl/info/guides/zelfbouwprojecten/cv-met-ventilatoren) to make my own radiator fans. The concept is simple: install fans that blow extra air trough radiator to increase the the speed in which the radiator can release its heat. The radiator fans are simple [usb fans](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/4000129511164.html) connected to [a hub](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/4000618337325.html). This hub is connected to an [Ikea TRÃ…DFRI smart socket](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/p/tradfri-wireless-control-outlet-90356166/).

## Software

Although this sounds more as a hardware project, there is an interesting software component: turing on the fans if the radiator is warm. I have a google nest thermostat which I can access via [an API](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access). The only thing left is to write software that retrieves from the thermostat if it's on, and if so: turn on the smart socket (which communicates via Zigbee).

## Summary

## .NET CORE application

The .NET core application uses oAuth2 to authenticate itself to the [Google device access API](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/traits). For me, this was the first serious introduction to oAuth2. I quickly had a basic application running that could read values from the API, by using [the get started guide](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started).

A request + response could look like this:
```json
curl -X GET 'https://smartdevicemanagement.googleapis.com/v1/enterprises/project-id/devices/{device-id-here}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer access-token-here'

### Quick data analysis
As you can see, the target- and current temperature are logged to a csv file for data analysis later on. For example:
