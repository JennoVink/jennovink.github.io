A little more than 2 years ago, I started working at vitas. During my time at vitas, I got the chance to work at 3 different companies and in the meantime get 5 certificates. The last company (Lijnco) now offered me a permanent position! I'm really exited and enjoy working for Lijnco. The thing that appeals to me the most is the diversity in the projects: every project is different and every project is a new oppertunity to do it a little better and a little more efficient. Besides that, the more projects we do, the bigger the chance that we can reuse code. That highly increases efficiency. 

I hope that this valuable collaboration continues for a long time.
