## You've found a secret blogpostðŸ˜€

I red [this blogpost](https://infosecwriteups.com/how-i-am-able-to-hijack-you-1cab793a01d1){:target="_blank"} and I decided to give it a try my self.

Watch this gif and go to [google.com](https://www.google.com) and type ```Jenno```.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/rnhg2ysm/show/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>

Note that in the PoC above, you have to press the button 'Run this fiddle'. In the example of the blogpost that wasn't needed (maybe by using embed.ly?).
